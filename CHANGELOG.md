## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-20

A security, reliability, and UX hardening release, plus fixes for two features
that were broken in production (caught by an end-to-end live QA pass).

### 🔒 Security

- **Authenticated the cloud sync API.** `/api/state` now requires a shared secret (`STATE_SYNC_SECRET`, entered once in **Project Settings → Cloud Sync** as a passphrase). Before this, a public deployment with Supabase enabled exposed the entire KV store to anonymous read / write / delete. ⚠️ **Breaking for cloud-sync users only:** set `STATE_SYNC_SECRET` and the passphrase, or sync requests are rejected (local-first mode is unaffected).
- **SSRF protection** on `/api/audit` (`lib/server/ssrf.ts`) — rejects internal/reserved targets (cloud metadata, localhost, private ranges) and re-validates every redirect hop.
- **Rate limiting** on all `/api/*` routes (`proxy.ts`) to curb API-cost abuse.
- **Fixed a data-loss race** where the initial empty state could overwrite stored data during load.
- **Dependencies:** Next.js 16.1.6 → 16.2.9; cleared the protobufjs RCE and related advisories.

### ⚡ Reliability

- Hard timeouts on every external call (`lib/server/http.ts`).
- `/api/bulk-sro` stops the SSE pipeline on client disconnect (no more burning API credits after a tab close).
- Debounced state saves, bounded in-memory caches, NDJSON parse hardening, tightened input validation, and upstream error bodies are no longer leaked to clients.

### 🎨 Design

- **Overview-first dashboard** — lands on a Visibility Analytics overview instead of the prompt table.
- New **"Visibility by AI engine"** per-model bars.
- KPI strip + Top Movers scoped to the overview (no longer repeated on every tab); slimmer demo banner; unified color tokens (fixes SRO colors that broke in light mode).

### 🐛 Fixes (found in live QA)

- **SRO Analysis + Site Context were broken in production:** the OpenRouter model `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` was retired (404 "No endpoints found"). Switched to `google/gemini-2.5-flash` (overridable via `OPENROUTER_MODEL`).
- **Competitor Battlecards timed out:** the single combined request exceeded the edge/serverless limits. Split into per-competitor parallel requests on the Node runtime, with a reliable structured-output model via a new optional `model` param on `/api/analyze`.

### 🧪 Demo

- Refreshed sample data so the demo exercises every feature: populated Citation Opportunities, a full sentiment mix, an 8-point rising visibility trend, and a seeded SRO Analysis result.
- Reframed the demo to a neutral example brand (a fictional meal-kit service) and cleared the default competitor list.

### 📝 Docs / Config

- Documented new env vars: `BRIGHT_DATA_SERP_ZONE`, `BRIGHT_DATA_UNLOCKER_ZONE`, `STATE_SYNC_SECRET`, and the optional `OPENROUTER_MODEL`.
- Fixed stale repo URLs and the live-demo link.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-04-17

### ✨ New: Optional Supabase cloud persistence

Local-first storage (IndexedDB) remains the default. When you supply three env vars, all app state is automatically synced to your own free Supabase project — across devices, deploys, and browser clears.

**What changed**

- **`app/api/state/route.ts`** — new `GET / PUT / DELETE` route that proxies reads and writes to Supabase using the `service_role` key server-side. The client never calls Supabase directly. Returns `501` gracefully when cloud is not configured.
- **`lib/server/supabase.ts`** — `getServerSupabase()` singleton; reads `SUPABASE_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` + `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- **`lib/server/kv-store.ts`** — `kvGet` / `kvSet` / `kvDelete` helpers used by the route.
- **`lib/client/cloud-mode.ts`** — `isCloudAvailable()` (build-time env flag) and `isCloudEnabledByUser()` (per-browser localStorage toggle, defaults to `true` when cloud is available).
- **`lib/client/sovereign-store.ts`** — rewired to branch on `isCloudActive()`. IDB becomes a local cache when cloud is active; IDB is the authoritative fallback if the cloud route fails. Public API (`loadSovereignValue` / `saveSovereignValue` / `clearSovereignStore`) is unchanged — all existing callers work without modification.
- **`components/dashboard/tabs/project-settings-tab.tsx`** — new **Cloud Sync** card in Project Settings. Shows setup instructions when cloud is not configured; shows an enable/disable toggle when it is.
- **`supabase/migrations/001_kv_store.sql`** — single-table `kv_store` schema (`key TEXT PK, value JSONB, created_at, updated_at`) with an `updated_at` trigger. Paste and run in your Supabase SQL editor to set up.
- **`package.json`** — added `@supabase/supabase-js ^2.103.3`.
- **`README.md`** — new "☁️ Optional: Cloud persistence with Supabase" section with 5-step setup guide; architecture tree updated; API routes table updated; Cloud Sync added to nav.

**Env vars needed (all optional)**

```env
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key   # server-side only, never exposed to client
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUD_STORAGE_ENABLED=true
```

**What is NOT synced (intentionally local)**

- Theme preference
- Workspace list / active workspace
- The `sovereign-cloud-sync` toggle state itself

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-22

### ✨ Features

- **Prompt tags** — inline tag editing on prompts; filter bar to narrow prompt list by tag
- **Delete individual responses** — confirmation dialog guards accidental deletes
- **Multiple website URLs** — chip-based input supporting multiple URLs per brand

## [1.0.0] — 2026-03-13

### ✨ Features

- **SRO Analysis** — full 6-stage pipeline: Gemini Grounding → Cross-Platform Citations → SERP → Page Scraping → Site Context → LLM Analysis. Produces SRO Score (0–100) with prioritized recommendations.
- **Parallel batch runs** — all prompt × model combos execute simultaneously via `Promise.allSettled()`
- **Mobile-responsive** — collapsible sidebar (hamburger at `md:` breakpoint), backdrop overlay, responsive KPI grid and model toolbar

### 🆕 New API routes

`/api/sro-analyze`, `/api/bulk-sro` (SSE), `/api/serp`, `/api/site-context`, `/api/unlocker`, `/api/brightdata-platforms`

### 🐛 Fix

- Grok badge invisible in light mode (#1)
